# Lotus Mandala

Experiment to create a coloring book script for the 10k Apart contest by An Event Apart: https://a-k-apart.com/. 

The petals, center, and the outline can be filled in by the palette provided.  

Inspiried from Sanders Kleinfeld's HTML5 for Publishers: http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000770/ch05.html

Original JQuery replaced and rewritten in vanilla Javascript to fit event guidelines.

Server compresses the project to 8.8kB.
